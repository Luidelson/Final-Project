## ShowMe

### What this project does
- Lets anyone discover TV shows with a clean, fast UI.
- Fetches show data (via the backendâ€™s TVmaze proxy) and displays:
  - Paginated lists, cover images, premiere dates, ratings, and genres.
  - A show details modal with summary and star ratings.
- Provides search and genre filters to quickly find content.
- Enables authenticated users to:
  - Save shows to their account (favorites/watchlist).
  - Track progress (e.g., season/episode and related metadata).
  - Edit profile info (username, avatar).
- Uses semantic HTML, ARIA, and BEM-based CSS for accessibility and responsiveness.
